# Sales Performance

## Project Title
Sales Performance

## Description
This project involves the creation of two interactive dashboards using Tableau to provide insights into sales performance and customer behavior. The dashboards cater to the needs of stakeholders, including sales managers and marketing teams, by offering visual representations of key performance indicators (KPIs), trends, and comparisons.

## What I Did
- **Developed Two Dashboards**: Created a Sales Dashboard and a Customer Dashboard to visualize relevant data.
  
- **Sales Dashboard**: 
  - Summarized total sales, profits, and quantity metrics for the current and previous years.
  - Analyzed monthly sales trends to identify peak and low sales periods.
  - Compared sales performance across product subcategories.
  - Illustrated weekly sales and profit trends, highlighting significant deviations from averages.

- **Customer Dashboard**:
  - Provided an overview of total customers, sales per customer, and total orders for the current and previous years.
  - Analyzed monthly customer trends to recognize periods of highest and lowest activity.
  - Represented customer distribution based on the number of orders placed.
  - Identified the top 10 customers by profit, showcasing key details like rank and order history.

- **Interactivity**: Implemented interactive features allowing users to filter data by product categories, customer segments, and geographical locations. Enabled dynamic year selection for historical analysis.

## Phases of Development
1. **Analyze Requirements**: Gathered and understood the specifications for the dashboards, focusing on the needs of stakeholders.
2. **Build Data Source**: Prepared and organized the necessary data to ensure accurate and meaningful analysis.
3. **Build Charts**: Created various charts to visualize the data effectively, representing key metrics and trends.
4. **Build Dashboards**: Combined the charts into cohesive dashboards, ensuring usability and interactivity for end-users.

## Skills Learned
- **Data Visualization**: Enhanced skills in presenting data visually, making complex data more understandable for stakeholders.
- **Dashboard Design**: Gained experience in designing intuitive and user-friendly dashboards that facilitate data analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Improved ability to analyze sales and customer data, identifying trends and making data-driven decisions.
- **Interactivity in Tableau**: Learned how to create interactive elements in dashboards, enhancing user engagement and data exploration.

## Tools Used
- **Tableau**: Utilized Tableau for creating dashboards and visualizations.

## Conclusion
This project has significantly strengthened my data visualization skills and my ability to interpret sales and customer data effectively. The dashboards I created serve as valuable tools for stakeholders to make informed decisions based on analyzed data. This was built during my learning phase and was inspired by a YouTube tutorial.
